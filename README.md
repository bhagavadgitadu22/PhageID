# Snakemake workflow: BIOVIR_Champery_2023

A Snakemake workflow for `<description>`

# TODO

* Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.
* Give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) sitory and its DOI.
